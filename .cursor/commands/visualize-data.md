# visualize-data

Generate diverse, publication-quality data visualizations using modern Python visualization libraries. Creates elegant, standalone charts with creative freedom and globally configurable output settings.

## Global Configuration

Configure default visualization behavior at the top of generated scripts:

```python
# ==================== GLOBAL SETTINGS ====================
OUTPUT_FORMATS = ["png"]                    # Change to: ["png", "pdf", "svg"], ["html", "png"], etc.
OUTPUT_DPI = 300                            # Resolution (300=publication, 150=web)
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = "visualizations"         # Output folder for all generated files
FIGURE_COUNT = 6                            # Number of standalone charts (range: 4-8)
COLOR_PALETTE = "husl"                      # Options: "husl", "deep", "pastel", "Set2", "Spectral"
STYLE_THEME = "seaborn-v0_8-darkgrid"      # Options: "default", "seaborn-v0_8-darkgrid", "ggplot", "bmh"
INTERACTIVE_ELEMENTS = True                 # Include interactive features where applicable
FIGURE_SIZE = (14, 10)                      # Base figure dimensions
# ============================================================
```

## Visualization Generation Approach

### Step 0: Data Exploration & Intelligence Gathering (CRITICAL)
Before planning any visuals, gain a deep understanding of the data structure and quality by writing and executing a **temporary exploration script**:
1. **Create Exploration Script**: Write a temporary file (e.g., `temp_data_exploration.py`) that performs the following:
   - **Schema Inspection**: `df.info()`, `df.columns`, and `df.head()` to understand names, types, and shape.
   - **Statistical Summary**: `df.describe(include='all')` to identify ranges, means, and potential outliers.
   - **Quality Audit**: Check for missing values (`df.isnull().sum()`) and unique value counts for categorical variables.
   - **Distribution Profiling**: Check skewness or `value_counts()` for key variables to identify data density.
   - **Relationship Scanning**: Check correlations (`df.corr()`) or cross-tabulations for specified variables.
2. **Execute & Analyze**: Run the script in the terminal, capture the output, and analyze the results to inform the visualization strategy.
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: **MANDATORY**: Delete the temporary exploration script immediately after gathering the necessary insights.

**Outcome**: Use these quantified insights to choose chart types that highlight real patterns rather than visualizing noise or empty categories.

### Step 1: Initialization & Planning (MANDATORY)
1. **Create a Todo List**: Immediately create a structured task list to track progress for this session. Update it as work progresses.
2. **Environment Setup**: Verify required libraries are available (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, etc.). Install missing dependencies if needed.
3. **Output Directory Setup**: Create the output directory if it doesn't exist. Use `Path(output_directory).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`.
4. **Insight Integration**: Review the findings from **Step 0**. Identify unique data characteristics, temporal/spatial aspects, and outliers that deserve specialized visual attention.
5. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data (handle missing values, outliers, type conversions) based on the exploration phase. Document all preprocessing.
6. **MCP Documentation Lookup**: Use MCP tools (e.g., `mcp_exa_get_code_context_exa`) to retrieve up-to-date documentation and "best-in-class" code examples for the chosen visualization libraries (Seaborn, Plotly, etc.). Search for "publication quality [library] examples" or "advanced [chart type] styling".
7. **Creative Brainstorming**: Develop a plan for 4-8 unique perspectives. Define the specific analytical objective for each standalone chart and choose the optimal library for each specific visual. Apply creative intelligence to find "hidden" stories revealed during Step 0.

### Step 2: Standalone Chart Generation (Strictly Single Panel)
Generate 4-8 **separate, standalone visualizations** with creative freedom—each chart:
- **NO MULTI-PANEL VISUALS**: Each file must contain exactly one chart. No subplots, no faceted grids in one file, no dashboards.
- **File naming convention (MANDATORY)**: Files must be named with sequential numbering first, followed by a descriptive title related to the chart content. Format: `01_chart_title.png`, `02_chart_title.png`, `03_chart_title.png`, etc. The number (01-08) comes first, then an underscore, then a descriptive title that reflects what the chart shows (e.g., `01_distribution_analysis.png`, `02_scatter_with_regression.png`, `03_temporal_trends.png`).
- **Single perspective per file**: One focused insight per visualization. Layered elements (e.g., trendlines on scatter) are encouraged, but multiple axes/panels are forbidden.
- **Independent analysis**: Each chart stands alone with complete axis labels and captions.
- **No linking**: Charts are independent, not connected through interactive filters or selections.

### Step 3: Multi-Perspective Visualization Diversity
Select diverse chart types with creative freedom to choose from:

**Core Visualization Types**:
- Statistical distributions (violin plots, ridge plots, density curves)
- Relational analysis (scatter plots with regression/confidence intervals, joint distributions)
- Comparative patterns (box plots, categorical plots - each as a standalone file)
- Temporal trends (line charts, area plots, time-series decomposition)
- Multivariate relationships (heatmaps, correlation matrices, parallel coordinates)
- Advanced techniques (3D surfaces, animated transitions, interactive hover details)

**Inspiration from Modern Libraries**:
- **Plotly**: Interactive 3D visualizations, animated transitions, hover details
- **Seaborn**: Statistical graphics with automatic confidence intervals and aesthetic refinement
- **Altair**: Declarative visualizations (one chart per output)
- **Matplotlib**: Publication-ready static output with fine-grained customization
- **HoloViews/Bokeh**: Large dataset handling, interactive zooming (standalone charts only)
- **Polars integration**: High-performance data operations before visualization

**Creative Combination Strategies** (each as separate file):
- Distribution analysis with trend overlay
- Comparative breakdowns across categorical dimensions
- Temporal progression visualizations
- Relationship and correlation displays
- Network-style relationship diagrams
- Color-coded statistical analysis with annotations

### Step 4: Academic Publication Quality Standards
Ensure scholarly excellence through:
- **Visual clarity**: Appropriate chart selection for data patterns, clear labeling, logical color schemes
- **Statistical rigor**: Confidence intervals, significance markers, proper error representations
- **Aesthetic polish**: Professional typography, consistent styling, accessibility-compliant colors
- **Information efficiency**: High data-to-ink ratio, minimal decoration, focused visual hierarchy
- **Reproducibility**: Complete code documentation with random seed management for consistent results
- **Format flexibility**: Easy one-setting changes at script top for multiple output formats/resolutions

### Step 5: Code Generation & Execution
Produce professional Python scripts with:
- **Clean organization**: Imports section, global settings, helper functions, main visualization pipeline
- **Modular design**: Separate functions for each chart type enabling selective regeneration
- **Reproducibility**: Set random seeds (`np.random.seed(42)`, `random.seed(42)`) at the start for consistent results
- **File naming (MANDATORY)**: Use sequential numbering (01, 02, 03, etc.) followed by underscore and descriptive title related to the chart content. 
  - **Format**: `NN_chart_title.png` where NN is zero-padded number (01-08) and chart_title describes the visualization
  - **Examples**: `01_distribution_analysis.png`, `02_scatter_with_regression.png`, `03_temporal_trends.png`, `04_correlation_heatmap.png`
  - **Rules**: Number must come first, use zero-padding (01 not 1), descriptive title must relate to chart content, number sequentially from 01 up to total count (4-8)
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of missing values, data type conversions, edge cases
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient data subsetting for large datasets, vectorized operations. For very large datasets (>100K rows), consider sampling or aggregation.
- **Memory management**: Close figures explicitly (`plt.close()` or `fig.close()`) to prevent memory leaks
- **Documentation**: Clear comments explaining each visualization's purpose and analytical approach
- **Extensibility**: Easy modification of chart parameters without touching core logic

### Step 6: Iterative Execution & Visual Review (MANDATORY)
1. **Run & Fix**: Execute the generated Python code. If errors occur (missing libraries, data type issues), fix them immediately and rerun until execution is 100% successful.
2. **File Verification**: Verify all expected output files were created. Check that file count matches the planned number of visualizations (4-8 files).
3. **Visual Quality Review**: Inspect the generated image files. If a chart looks "messy," "amateur," or "cluttered," **go back and refine the code** until the visual output is elegant, professional, and clean.
4. **Academic Publication Standards**: Check for visual clarity, professional typography, consistent styling, and accessibility-compliant colors. Ensure high data-to-ink ratio and focused visual hierarchy.
5. **Iterate Until Perfect**: Continue refining code and regenerating visuals until all charts meet publication-quality standards.
6. **Update Todo List**: Mark completed tasks in the todo list as work progresses.

### Step 7: Output Delivery & Concise Documentation
- **Minimal README**: Provide exactly ONE concise `README.md` in the output directory that includes:
  - Brief description of the analysis performed
  - List of generated visualizations with file names and brief descriptions
  - Data source information
  - Key insights or findings (if applicable)
  - Technical details (libraries used, DPI, formats)
- **Code Comments**: Ensure the Python script has clear comments explaining the purpose of each visualization function.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Multi-panel visuals**: Never create subplots, faceted grids, or dashboards in a single file
- **Forgotten figure cleanup**: Always call `plt.close()` or `fig.close()` after saving to prevent memory issues
- **Stale exploration scripts**: Always delete temporary data exploration scripts (`temp_data_exploration.py`) after use
- **Inconsistent styling**: Use global matplotlib rcParams settings for consistent fonts, sizes, and colors
- **Missing error handling**: Handle missing data, empty datasets, and edge cases gracefully
- **Poor file naming**: Use sequential numbering first (01, 02, 03, etc.), then underscore, then descriptive title related to chart content. Format must be `01_chart_title.png`, not generic names or titles without numbers.
- **Skipping visual review**: Always inspect actual output files, not just code
- **No reproducibility**: Always set random seeds for any random operations
- **Large file sizes**: For high DPI outputs, consider file size implications
