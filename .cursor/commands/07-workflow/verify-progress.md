# verify-progress

Comprehensive validation command for research project progress documentation. Systematically verifies that all claims, implementations, and deliverables described in a progress/todo file actually exist and function as stated.

## Purpose & Methodology

This command performs rigorous academic validation of project documentation by:
1. **Parsing Documentation Claims**: Extracts specific assertions about implementations, outputs, and achievements
2. **Codebase Verification**: Confirms that described code implementations exist and function correctly
3. **Artifact Validation**: Verifies that all mentioned output files, tables, and datasets actually exist
4. **Success Metric Confirmation**: Validates that claimed success rates, sample sizes, and performance metrics are accurate
5. **Cross-Consistency Checking**: Identifies any inconsistencies, errors, or incomplete implementations

## Validation Process

### Step 1: Documentation Analysis
- Parse the progress file to identify specific claims and assertions
- Extract references to code files, data files, output artifacts, and success metrics
- Build validation checklist from documented achievements and deliverables

### Step 2: Implementation Verification
- **Code Files**: Confirm existence, check line numbers, verify implementations match descriptions
- **Data Files**: Validate file existence, sizes, modification dates, and content structure
- **Output Artifacts**: Verify tables, figures, and datasets contain expected content and formatting

### Step 3: Success Metric Validation
- Check that claimed sample sizes, match rates, and performance metrics are achieved
- Verify statistical results match documented findings
- Confirm data quality metrics and integration success rates

### Step 4: Error Detection & Reporting
- Identify discrepancies between documentation and actual implementation
- Flag missing files, incorrect claims, or incomplete implementations
- Provide actionable recommendations for any issues found

## Usage Examples

### Basic Progress Verification
```
/verify-progress "Plan.md"
```
Validates all claims in the main project plan.

### Phase-Specific Validation
```
/verify-progress "Results/Phase_3_Implementation.md"
```
Validates specific phase documentation.

### Multi-Document Validation
```
/verify-progress "Plan.md"
```
/verify-progress "Results/Implementation_Details.md"
```
Sequential validation of multiple documentation files.

## Quality Standards
